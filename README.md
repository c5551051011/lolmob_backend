# lolmob Backend

This repository contains a minimal FastAPI project serving as a template for a REST API.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API provides basic CRUD operations under `/items`.
